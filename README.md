# ALU AirBnB Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application, developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage objects representing AirBnB data models (Users, Places, Reviews, etc.). The backend is built in Python using object-oriented programming principles and will later be extended to include a web interface.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionality of the AirBnB platform, focusing on building:
- A custom command interpreter for managing the backend
- Classes that represent data models
- Serialization and deserialization of data
- Persistent storage (initially using JSON)
- An extensible and maintainable codebase

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is the first part of the project and is used to manage the AirBnB objects. It functions as a custom shell that allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of instances from different classes.

### How to Start the Console

To start the command interpreter, run the following in the project root directory:

```bash
$ ./console.py
